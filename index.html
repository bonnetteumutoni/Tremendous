        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Upon first arriving at AkiraChix, I was amazed by the beautiful and serenity of the extraordinary mansion. I truly appreciated the warm welcome we received, with beautiful smiles gracing every face. The willingness of everyone to offer assistance whenever I needed it was heartwarming and greatly appreciated.
            </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;" > The first week was very long as I had to learn and adapt to everything and people I found here. I was surprised by how this school has a lot of cats running around and they’re all beautiful&#128522.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Of Course it was happy because i didn’t have to carry anything as they provided anything i could need while living in the campus&#128524:</p>
        <h2 style="color: blue;">the following are daily materials needed that were provided to me:</h2>
